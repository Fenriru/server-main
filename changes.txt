CHANGES MADE:
2. Reworked so that it would send the client data in a new separate function with the correct calculations for retrieving the header and the body in the data

3. Fixed up getting the end of the header from using strstr 2 places after the pointer for start

4. Fixed up the same thing for reading and writing requests

5. Added file descriptor access for that request, and used snprintf for formatting it before sending the message to the client with the new format. Also added a while loop to consistently send body data to the client while it is reading instead of sending only one body message

6. Fixed up so that it would send the correct error messages in handle write and echo for format mistake or the 404 response

7. Fixed up so that it would send the too large error message in handle write and handle echo in checking the size in those triggers

8. Formatted the header and body accordingly with their data values, then rework to constantly update those values while retrieving

9/10. Set up the Epoll system so that it would handle multiple clients correctly -- added the while loop to consistently check for the event trigger whether to add a new client descriptor or to process one that directly called an event for interaction. Added proper deletion of clients that finished processing or no longer needs anything from the server.
